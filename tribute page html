                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

                <li>
                    In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of
                    the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                    which helped earn him the nickname <strong> “Missile Man.”</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
                    incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

                    honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for
                    his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
                </li>

                    to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the
                    recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the
                    management and leadership of a space-related project".
